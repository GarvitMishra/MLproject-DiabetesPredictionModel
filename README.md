# MLproject-DiabitesePredictionModel

# Diabetes Prediction using python

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various attributes such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The project utilizes a dataset containing these attributes along with their corresponding outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following attributes:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating the presence of diabetes

## Project Structure

The project's repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model/`: This directory contains the trained machine learning model.
